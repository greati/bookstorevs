#Book Store

Contains a full implementation of a simple Book Store, built from scratch using C#, ASP.NET and Linq, all in Visual Studio 2012.

It was an academic project and can serves to those who need examples of CRUD, ORM and project organization when handling C# and ASP.NET.

##Setting up
1. Import to Visual Studio

And that's it! Why? I used a lot of native tools of that IDE, so you can just open the project and it will, I hope, work correctly.
